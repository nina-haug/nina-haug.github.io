I am a Senior Data Scientist with a strong background in applied mathematics and physics, specializing in the analysis of medical real world data. My current work focuses on oncology real world data, biostatistics and causal inference.

I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Queen Mary University of London and a Master’s in Physics from Humboldt University of Berlin.
